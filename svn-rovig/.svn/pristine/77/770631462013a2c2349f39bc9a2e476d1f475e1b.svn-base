\abstract {
The goal of this project is to exploit the huge potential of finite element approaches based on the approximation of stresses as the dual variable for variational inequalities in solid mechanics. This includes models of frictional contact as well as elasto-plastic deformations and emphasizes adaptive refinement strategies based on built-in a posteriori error estimators as well as efficient iterative solution methods for the arising non-smooth problems. Approximating stresses directly by suitable finite element spaces allows for algorithmic simplifications and improved accuracy, in particular, in association with plasticity and friction where stress components play a prominent role. \\
In the present prospectus we examine the Least Square (LS) Finite Element Method (FEm) appliaed to linear elasticity and different kinds of Multigrid methods (MG) for $H_{\div}$ problems. In the future it would be desirable extending what has been discovered so far also for contact problems.

\section{Linear elasticity and its weak formulations: why LSFEM?}
In this section we want to stress out why the choice of the LSFEM can be a good candidate for the solution of linear elasticity. In particular it is when we want to deal with an incompressible solid or solve accurately for the stresses. \textbf{Since the explanation is the same for the contact case, we focus only on linear elasticity to make the speech easier(dillo altrove).}\\
Let $\Omega$ be an open, bounded, connected subset of $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d=2,3$ is the dimension of the problem. The boundary $\partial \Omega$, Lipschitz and continuous, is the union of two open disjoint subsets $\partial \Omega= \Gamma_D \cup \Gamma_N$, with  $\Gamma_D \neq \emptyset$ and  $\Gamma_D \cap\Gamma_N = \emptyset$.\\
Then let $\bff=(f_1,...,f_d)^T$ be the body force, $\bu=(u_1,...,u_d)^T$ the displacement field,  $\bsigma=(\sigma_{ij})_{d \times d}$ the stress tensor. The strong formulation of linear elasticity is the following:\textit{ find $\bu$, $\bsigma$ such that}:
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\text{div} \bsigma + \bff=0 & \Omega  \qquad \text{momentum balance equation}\\
\mathcal{A} \bsigma - \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)=0 &\Omega \qquad \text{constitutive law}\\
\bu = \bu^D & \Gamma_D\qquad \text{Dirichlet BC}\\
\bsigma  \bn = \bt^N & \Gamma_N\qquad \text{Neumann BC}\\
\end{cases} 
\end{align*}
where the linearized strain tensor $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)= \text{sym} (\nabla \bu)$ is the symmetric part of the displacement gradient, the compliance tensor is $\mathcal{A}=\dfrac{1}{2 \mu} \left(\bsigma-\dfrac{\lambda}{d \lambda + 2 \mu } \text{tr} \bsigma \bI\right)$ with $\text{tr}$, $d$, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ denoting respectively the trace operator, the dimension of the problem and the Lam\eeee${}$ parameters.\\
From the strong formulation of the linear elasticity we can derive different variants of weak forms. By substituing the constitutive equation ($\bsigma = \mathcal{C}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)$, with $\mathcal{C}=\mathcal{A}^{-1}$ the elasticity tensor) into the momentum balance one, we obtain the displacement formulation. Since we solve directly for displacements ($\bu \in H^1(\Omega)$), the stresses are derived \textit{a posteriori} and cannot be carefully approximated. Furthermore locking phenomena can arise for incompressible or nearly incompressible solids ($\lambda \gg 1$ or $\lambda \to \infty$).\\
To achieve a better approximation of the stresses, the dual mixed formulation by Hellinger-Reissner can be used. Given the energy-functional $\mathcal{J}(\bu,\bsigma)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathcal{A} \bsigma, \bsigma \right) + \left(\nabla \cdot \bsigma + \bff, \bu \right)  $, we search for both displacement and stresses $(\bu,\bsigma) \in L^2(\Omega)^d  \times  H_{\text{div},S}(\Omega)^d$, where $H_{\text{div},S}(\Omega)^d$ is the space of symmetric tensors in $H_{\text{div}}(\Omega)$. In this case, in order to satisfy the inf-sup condition in the discrete setting, a stable combination of finite element spaces is needed. Although such spaces have been built, the number of degrees of freedem they require is very large. Furthermore the corresponding linear system is a saddle point problem, that in general is difficult to solve. \\
The approach that we here present is based on the least-square principle. The main idea is to build a fictitious functional as the sum of the squared $L^2$-norms of the residuals of the equations defined on the domain. For the linear elasticity, this is translated in finding $\bu \in H^1(\Omega)$, $\bsigma \in H_{\text{div}}(\Omega)$ that satisfy essential boundary conditions (bc) and that minimize the least-square functional:
\begin{align*}
 \mathcal{J}(\bu,\bsigma)=C_{eq} ||\text{div} \bsigma+\bff||_{L^2(\Omega)^d}^2+C_{const} ||\mathcal{A}\bsigma -\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)||_{L^2(\Omega)^d}^2   \quad \rightarrow \quad (\tilde{\bu},\tilde{\bsigma})=\text{argmin}\mathcal{J}(\bu,\bsigma)
\end{align*}
Since the functional is continuous, convex and positive definite, its minimum, i.e the weak formulation, can be derived by enforcing the first-order necessary optimality condition. The problem becomes: search for $(\bu, \bsigma) \in $ $\left[H_{\Gamma_d}^1(\Omega) \right]^d\times \left[ H_{\Gamma_N}^{\text{div}}(\Omega) \right]^d$ such that:
\begin{align*}
 \begin{cases}
C_{eq}(\text{div} \bsigma , \text{div} \btau) + C_{const} (\mathcal{A} \bsigma,\mathcal{A} \btau) - C_{const}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu),\mathcal{A} \btau)=-C_{eq}(\bff , \text{div} \btau) & \forall \btau \in \left[ H_{\Gamma_N^0}^{\text{div}}(\Omega) \right]^d \\
- C_{const}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bv),\mathcal{A} \bsigma)+
C_{const}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu),\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bv))=0 & \forall \bv \in \left[H_{\Gamma_{d}^0}^1(\Omega) \right]^d\\
\bu = \bu^D & \Gamma_D\\
\bsigma  \bn = \bt^N & \Gamma_N\\
 \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where the spaces with the pedex $\Gamma_d$, $\Gamma_N$ satisfy the bc of the problem, whilst the ones with $\Gamma_d^0$, $\Gamma_N^0$ have homogeneous ones.\\
The weights $C_{eq}$ and $C_{const}$ have to be determined. Because the LS-functional is fictitious and has no physical meaning, this decision has to be made a posteriori and will influence also the symmetry of the stress tensor. From (\textbf{PAPER STARKE ELASTICITA}), we know that the asimmetry of stresses can be bounded by the constitutive law: $||\sigma-\sigma^T||\leq 4 \mu || \mathcal{A} \bsigma-\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)||$. So we could think of using $C_{const} \gg C_{eq}$ to ensure its simmetry. Nevertheless, in this way, the equilibrium  is not well captured and the solution will be not satisfactory. This behaviour can be well understood in the case of a beam subjct to bending \textbf{(INSERISCI IMMAGINI}). Therefore we prefer to add the condition on simmetry in the LS-functional, with a proper weight $C_{asym}$ such that $C_{eq}$, $C_{asym}$ are both greater than $C_{const}$. By adopting this model, we are able also to treat bending, that otheriwse would be difficult to describe. Then the functional is:
\begin{align*}
 \mathcal{J}(\bu,\bsigma)=C_{eq} ||\text{div} \bsigma+\bff||_{L^2(\Omega)^d}^2+C_{const} ||\mathcal{A}\bsigma -\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)||_{L^2(\Omega)^d}^2 +C_{asym}  ||\bsigma- \bsigma^T||_{L^2(\Omega)^d}
\end{align*}
Let us examine a 2D rectangular beam, whose length and height are $a=1$ and $b=0.2$, subject to a uniform load on the top $f_y=-0.005$ and clamped on the left side. We want to vary the coefficients $\lambda=1,5,50,1e7$ and $\mu=1,5,50$, $C_{eq}=1,10,100,1000$ and $C_{asym}=0,1,10,100,1000$ in order to understand the best combination for $C_{eq}$ and $C_{asym}$ . As a comparison, we will consider the solution obtained with the displacement formulation. This will be meaningfull only for the cases $\lambda=1,5,50$, since for $\lambda=1e7$ locking phenomena occur. For this reason, given the table (\textbf{REFER TO THE TABLE}), we devide each column by its maximum and then sum up the derived values for each raw. Among all these, the minimum one refers to the best pairs of $C_{eq}$ and $C_{asym}$. In the case of $\lambda=1e7$, we take into consideration only the last three columns.

We can see that, in general, we want a large value for $C_{eq}$, while $C_{asym}$ can be smaller but never zero. In the case $\lambda=1$, $\mu=1$, neglecting the asymmetry and using $C_{eq}=C_{const}=1$ determines a huge error in the displacement component (\textbf{see picture}). \\

 For fixed mesh and parameters, we can find optimal values for $C_{eq}$, $C_{asym}$ and $C_{const}$. Nevertheless, everytime we change the setting of the problem, the constants will change as well. Anyhow we can try to make them more mesh-indipendent. Through a dimensional analysis, we can understand how each term of the functional scales with respect to the mesh size. Of course we have ti make some simplifying assumptions. Let $\bphi$ and $\lambda$ be respectively the $\RT$ and $P^1$ shape functions. Then an educated guess is:
 \begin{align*}
\bphi=\dfrac{1}{d V} (\bbx-\bc) \propto h^{1-d} \qquad
\text{div} \bphi  \propto h^{-d}  \qquad
\nabla \lambda \propto h^{-1}
\end{align*}
where V is the area/volume in dimension d=2,3. Therefore we can state that the terms of the LS-functional
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}=|| \text{div} \bsigma+ \bff||^2 + ||\mathcal{A}\bsigma -\varepsilon(\bu) ||^2 + || \bsigma -\bsigma^T||^2 
\end{align*}
scale in the following way:
\begin{align*}
\bphi_{\RT}=\dfrac{1}{d V} (\bbx-\bc) \propto h^{1-d} \qquad
\text{div} \bphi_{\RT} \ \propto h^{-d}  \qquad
\nabla \lambda \ \propto h^{-1}
\end{align*}
So:
\begin{itemize}
\item  $
|| \text{div} \bphi||_{L^2}^2=\int_V (\text{div} \bphi ,\text{div} \bphi) \propto h^{d} h^{-d}h^{-d}=h^{-d}
$
\item $
||\mathcal{A}\bphi -\varepsilon(\lambda) ||^2=||\mathcal{A}\bphi ||_{L^2}^2-2(\mathcal{A}\bphi ,\varepsilon(\lambda) )_{L^2}   +||\varepsilon(\lambda)  ||_{L^2}^2 \propto (const + h^{2-d}) $, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $
||\mathcal{A}\bphi ||_{L^2}^2 =\int_V (\mathcal{A}\bphi ,\mathcal{A}\bpsi) \propto  h^{d} h^{1-d}h^{1-d}=h^{2-d}$\\
\item  $\int_V (\mathcal{A}\bphi ,\varepsilon(\lambda) ) \propto  h^{d} h^{1-d}h^{-1}=const$\\
\item  $||\varepsilon(\lambda)  ||_{L^2}^2 = \int_V (\varepsilon(\lambda) ,\varepsilon(\lambda) ) \propto  h^{d} h^{-1}h^{-1}=h^{d-2}
$
\end{itemize}
\item $|| \bphi -\bphi^T ||_{L^2}^2 =\int_V (\bphi -\bphi^T ,\bphi -\bphi^T ) \propto  h^{d} h^{1-d}h^{1-d}=h^{2-d} $ 
\end{itemize}
Consequently we have to chose mesh-dipendent parameters so that the derived system becomes mesh-indipendent.
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}= h^d C_{eq}|| \text{div} \bsigma+ \bff||^2 +  (C + h^{2-d})^{-1} C_{const}||\mathcal{A}\bsigma -\varepsilon(\bu) ||^2 + h^{d-2}C_{asym}|| \bsigma -\bsigma^T||^2 
\end{align*}
Depending on the value of $C$, the constitutive law could scale as the asymmetry term ($C\approx 0$) or being mesh indipendent ($C \gg 1$). Without a proper scaling, for $h \to 0$, the extradiagonal terms would overwhelm the diagonal ones, increasing the coupling between stresses and displacements.\\
When matrices are built, before somming them up, one has to take care of the extradiagonal term of the constitutive law and compare, for example, an average of the absolute value of its entrs to the meshwidth parameter.\\
Let us consider for the above beam, with $\lambda=\mu=1$ and subject to a uniform load on the top $f_y=-0.005$,  a structured mesh subdivided in $n=30,60,90,120$ and $m=25,50,75,100$  elements along the x and y axes. We find out that, for $C_{const}=1$, the best pairs of $C_{asym}$ and $C_{eq}$ is such that $C_{asym}=100$. The equilibrium coefficient is important and the bigger it is, the smaller is the residual of the momentum equation. Nevertheless the other terms, such as the error in the $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms, do not change significantly. Since, by increasing $C_{eq}$ too much, we also increase the condition number of the relative matrix, the rule of thumb says that a good choice can be $C_{eq}=1e8$.

 Let $\Omega$ be a unit square domain. We enforce homogeneous dirichlet BC on the displacement and volume force $f_1 = f_2=...$. (SCRIVI LA FORMULA).\\
 We create three different meshes with  30 x 30, 60 x 60, 90 x 90 elements. Since the exact solution is known (GUARDA ARTICOLO),  we can study the convergence of the  displacement variable in the $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms and of the stress components in the $L^2$ norms. In this way we can compare the results for the displacement formulation, the symmetric and asymmetric LS formulations.

Starting from this new functional, we can derive the weak formulation from the first-order necessary optimality condition. As before, what we obtain is nothing but the normal equations. Therefore, instead of solving $\bA \bbx =\bb$, we are going to solve $\bA^* \bA \bbx =\bA^* \bb$. Of course this is the reason why the system is positive definite. Unfortunately the new condition number is bounded from the previous condition number to the power of two: $K(A^* A) \leq K(A)^2$. A good preconditioning tecnique must be take into consideration in order to use iterative solvers. In particular we want to examine multigrid algorhitms.\\\\
We want to stress out the fact that the bc have been imposed directly in the space (essential {bc}), but we can also add boundary terms to volume ones ({natural bc}).  In the last case, a proper weight must be determined. Since it is desirable to reduce the number of free parameters, from now on we will deal only with essential {bc}.
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{F}(\bu,\bsigma)=\mathcal{F}_{\text{homogenous bc}}(\bu,\bsigma)+C_4 ||\bu-\bh ||_{[H^{1/2}(\Gamma_D)]^d}^2+ C_5 ||\bsigma  \bn - \bg  ||_{[H^{-1/2}(\Gamma_N)]^d}^2
\end{align*}
Furthermore the LS-functional can be adopted as an efficient and reliable a posteriori error estimator. Both properties are important and guarantee that we can refine/coarsen where the value of the functional is large/small. Let be $e$ the error and $|| \cdot||$ a proper norm. Then one can prove that (\textbf{ARTICOLI DI ELASTICITA CONTATTO POISSON}):
\begin{align*}
&C_1 ||\text{e}||  \overbrace{\leq}^{ \text{reliability} }  \mathcal{F} \overbrace{\leq}^{\text{efficiency}} C_2 ||\text{e}||  \quad \Rightarrow \quad
 ||\text{e}||   \to 0 \:\: \iff \:\: \mathcal{F} \to 0
\end{align*}
\section{FEM discretization}
In order to solve the LS functional, we have to discretize its weak formulation on a tassellation $\mathcal{T}_h$ of $\Omega$ of triangles/tetrahedra (2D/3D). Then we can choose proper discrete-space for the approximation of displacement and stresses.\\
An important feature of the LS-approach is that, in principle, it does not give rise to a saddle-point problem. A  positive definite system can be derived with any kind of conforming approximation space. In general, in order to discretize displacement and stresses, we use respectively the spaces $\bU_h$ and $\bSigma_h$, built from the first-order Lagrange FE space $P^1(T_h)$ and the zero-order Raviart-Thomas space  $\RT_0(T_h)$. The space $P^1(T_h)$ is scalar and its degrees of freedom (dofs) coincide with the vertices of the tassellation, while $\RT_0(T_h)$ is a vector-value FEspace whose dofs lie on the edges/faces (2D/3D). Once the problem has been discretize, we have to solve. To this end, we need suitable solvers.
\section{Geometric Multigrid in $H^{\text{div}}$}
It has been shown that the condition number of the LS system can be very large. Then an iterative solver with a proper preconditioner must be considered. In particular domain decomposition and multigrid methods (MG) are well-known for their $h-$indipendent convergence rate. For this reason, we want to investigate MG also in the context of LSFEM. The difference with respect to usual schemes is that in the LS approach the variables live respectively in $H^1$ and $H^{\text{div}}$. Therefore classical MG for $H^1$ is necessary, but not sufficient, since we have also to take care of the stress components. The amount of literature that tackles $H^1$-MG is very large (\textbf{REFERENCES TO H1 MG}), so we prefer to focus on $H^{\text{div}}$-MG.\\
Two are the principal factors of a MG method: the intergrid projections and the smoother operators. Let us discover the shape of  the $\RT_0$ projection operator from coarse to a finer space. When we prolongate a function from a coarser space C to a finer one F, we want that the average flux through each face is the same. Then, if $\mathcal{F}_{h}$ is the set of all the faces of the triangulation:
\begin{align*}
\Pi: \RT_{0,C} \to \RT_{0,F}: \qquad 
\int_{F_i} (\Pi_C^F \bv - \bv) \cdot \bn_{F_i}  d\bs =0\qquad \forall F_i \in \mathcal{F}_{h}
\end{align*}
By substituing
$\bv =\sum_{k=1}^{N_F} \phi_{k}^{\RT_{0,F}} v_{k,F}$ and $\Pi_C^F \bv =\sum_{j=1}^{N_C} \phi_{j}^{\RT_{0,C}} v_{j,C}$:
\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{N_F} v_{k,F} \int_{F_i}\phi_{k}^{\RT_{0,F}}  \cdot \bn_{F_i} d \bs =
\sum_{j=1}^{N_C} v_{j,C} \int_{F_i}\phi_{j}^{\RT_{0,C}}  \cdot \bn_{F_i}  d\bs        \qquad \forall F_i \in \mathcal{F}_{h}
\end{align*}
Because $ \delta_{ki} = \int_{F_i}\phi_{k}^{\RT_{0},F}  \cdot \bn_F d \bs$:
\begin{align*}
\bv_{F} =\Pi_C^F \bv_{C}\qquad
\Pi_{C,ij}^F =   \int_{F_i}\phi_{j}^{\RT_{0,C}}  \cdot \bn_{F_i}  d\bs      
\end{align*}
The  Raviart-Thomas $\Pi_C^F$ projection operator is a sparse matrix and its application does not even require to invert a mass matrix, like other $L^2$ projection operators do. Therefore problems for MG in $H^{\text{div}}$ can regard only the smoother. \\
The trivial first try would be using well-known smoothers for $H^1$. Unfortunately classical $H^1$-MG is not able to solve $H^{\text{div}}$ problems. Indeed the prerequisite of MG is that eigenfunctions associated to small eigenvalues can be well represented on coarse meshes. This is automatically satisfied in $H^1$, but it is not in $H^{\text{div}}$ because the kernel of the div operator, $\mathcal{N}(\text{div})$, is very large. For a better understanding, let us consider the two basic prototype weak forms  for $H^1$ and $H^{\text{div}}$ and the corresponding eigenvalues: 
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\Lambda_{H^1}(\bu,\bv)=(\bu,\bv)+(\nabla \bu,\nabla \bv) \\
\lambda_{H^1}=1+\frac{|\nabla \bu|_1^2}{||\bu||_{L^2}^2}
\end{cases}
\qquad 
\begin{cases}
\Lambda_{H^{\text{div}}}(\bu,\bv)=(\bu,\bv)+(\text{div} \bu,\text{div} \bv)\\
\lambda_{H^{\text{div}}}=1+\frac{|\text{div} \bu|_1^2}{||\bu||_{L^2}^2}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
It is obvious that the aforementioned essential requirement is fullfilled for the operator $\Lambda_{H^1}$.  The eigenvalue $\lambda_{H^1}$ decreses for less oscillatory functions and equals the unity for constant functions. Therefore on coarse meshes, these functions can be appropriately represented. 
On the other hand, $H^{\text{div}}$ small eigenvalues $\lambda_{H^{\text{div}}}$ can be associated to free-divergence functions with large gradients that a low-quality mesh is unable to characterize. In short, we cannot direclty approximate the elements of $\mathcal{N}(\text{div})$. This complication is reflected in the smoother property. \\\\
In order to tackle this undesirable feature, several tecniques have ben presented. We will investigate the ones by Arnold and Hiptmair. In both case, their theorems hold for a convex domains, but Hiptmair shows that also for non convex domain his MG-algorithm works properly. Of course, if a statement is not proofed by theory, it does not mean that statement is false.
\subsection{Arnold's Smoother}
The first approach we want to examine is the smoother by Arnold (\textbf{CITA}) that acts contemporarily on a whole patch of the mesh. Starke shows in \textbf{CITA} that this method can be easily extended for the LS system. For each vertex $\nu \in \mathcal{T}_h$, we define the patch $\Omega_{\nu}$ as the union of all the elements that share the vertex $\nu$. The smoother strategy is the following. Loop on all the vertices $\nu$ of the mesh and, for each $\nu$, solve the difference problem restricted to this small patch $\Omega_{\nu}$, imposing homogeneous dirichlet bc on the boundary of the patch:
\begin{align*}
\forall \nu:
\qquad
1)
\begin{cases}
\min_{\delta \bsigma_{\nu} \in \bSigma_h } \mathcal{F}(\bu_{\nu}^k ,\bsigma_{\nu}^k+ \delta \bsigma_{\nu} ) \quad \:\:\: \bsigma_{\nu}^{k+\frac{1}{2}}=\bsigma_{\nu}^k+\delta \bsigma_{\nu}\\
\min_{\delta \bu_{\nu} \in \bU_h} \mathcal{F}(\bu_{\nu}^k+ \delta \bu_{\nu} ,\bsigma_{\nu}^{k+\frac{1}{2}} ) \quad \bu_{\nu}^{k+1}=\bu_{\nu}^k+\delta \bu_{\nu},
\end{cases}
\quad
2)
\begin{cases}
\min_{\delta \bu_{\nu} \in \bU_h, \delta \bsigma_{\nu} \in \bSigma_h } \mathcal{F}(\bu_{\nu}^k+ \delta \bu_{\nu} ,\bsigma_{\nu}^k+ \delta \bsigma_{\nu} )\\
\bu_{\nu}^{k+1}=\bu_{\nu}^k+\delta \bu_{\nu},\quad \bsigma_{\nu}^{k+1}=\bsigma_{\nu}^k+\delta \bsigma_{\nu}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
In particular we can solve for the displacement and stresses separately of contemporarily. In the previous case, we have to solve for two smaller problems, while in the second one we solve only for one, but bigger. What is important in this kind of smoother is that we do not distinguish between $H^{\text{div}}$ and $H^1$. We go from a level to another one with the right projection operators and then simply use this smoother for both, displacement and stresses. Essentially it is a smoother for the overall LS-system that does not make any difference between $\bu$ and $\bsigma$. The problem is the non-locality of the operator, since its application regards a whole patch.
\subsection{Hiptmair's Smoother}
Another approach for smoothing the divergence-free components of the error has been proposed by Hiptmair (\textbf{CITA ARTICOLI}). By means of Helmholtz decomposition $H^{\text{div}}$ can be studied as the sum of the kernel of the divergence operator and its orthogonal complement, $H^{\text{div}}=\mathcal{N}(div)\oplus\mathcal{N}(div)^{\perp}$. Usual smoothers work properly only on the latter component, but do not on the first one, since we loose the ellipticity of the operator. Nevertheless we can take advantage of the commuting diagram and, in particular, of the fact that $\mathcal{N}(div)=\bcurl H^{\bcurl}$.  
Given $\bu=\bv+\bw$, with $\bv \in \mathcal{N}(div)$ and $\bw \in \mathcal{N}(div)^{\perp}$, we can approach $\bw$ with common smoothers. We cannot do the same for $\bv$, so we write it as $\bv=\bcurl \bphi$, with $\bphi$ potential variable belonging to $H^{\bcurl}$. Then we achieve a weak formulation in terms of $\bphi$ for which the problem of free-divergence functions disappears. Therefore our strategy is to solve for corrections in the potential space and then project them back in $H^{\text{div}}$. \\
In the FE discretization, it would be desirable to have two different subspaces of $H^{\text{div}}$ for  $\mathcal{N}(div)^{\perp}$ and $\mathcal{N}(div)$. Since we do know any pairs of this kind, we approximate $\mathcal{N}(div)^{\perp}$ by the whole space $\RT_0$ and the potential space $H^{\bcurl}$ by $\ND_1$, the first kind Nedelec space of the first order. Furthermore, since the smoothing process is carried out for each level of the MG method, in addition to intergrid projection operator $RT_C^F:\RT_{0,C}\to \RT_{0,F}$, we will need $\Pi_{\RT}^{\ND}: \RT_0\to \ND_1$ and $ND_C^F: \ND_{1,C} \to \ND_{1,F}$. We want to show that also in these cases the operators are sparse matrices for which no mass matrix has to be inverted. In particular we will examine the operator $\Pi_{\RT}^{\ND}: \RT_0\to \ND_1$, insofar as $ND_C^F$ can be computed in a similar way to $RT_C^F$.
\\
To project from $\RT_0$ to $\ND_1$ and viceversa, we need to relate the dofs of $\bv$ with the ones of $\bphi$. By the definition of degree of freedom of $\RT_0$ for the $i-$th face and expoliting $\bv=\bcurl \bphi$: 
\begin{align*}
\RT_i= \int_{F_i} \bv \cdot \bn_{f_i} d s=\int_{F_i} \bcurl \bphi \cdot \bn_{f_i} d s=\oint_{\partial F_i} \bphi \cdot d \br
\end{align*}
Then by definition of $\ND_1$ and depending on the orientation of the edges of the face:
\begin{align*}
\RT_i= \sum_{j=1}^3 \pm  \ND_j =\pm(\ND_a+\ND_b -\ND_c )
\end{align*}
Therefore, not only the projection from different levels of $\RT_0$  and $\ND_1$ is sparse and direcly available, but also the projection from $\ND_1$ to $\RT_0$ is. So, by means of this projection into the potential space, we have not introduced other problematic issue.\\
A sketch for a two-level $H^{\text{div}}$-MG is the following:

${}$\\
For this reason, the present work aims to extend this idea from the basic example of the $a(\bu,\bv)=(\bu,\bv)+(\text{div}\bu,\text{div}\bv)$ to LS linear elasticity, with general bc. In contrast to Arnold smoother that acts upon the overall system, now we have two different MG that can be applied separately on the displacement and the stresses. 
Fortunately, \textbf{GUARDA ARNOLD PRECONDITIONING IN HDIV}, we can use a block preconditioning strategy. This means we can apply $H^1$-MG and $H^{\text{div}}$-MG indipendently:
\begin{align*}
\bP=\begin{bmatrix}
MG_{\bM_{\bsigma,\bsigma}H^{\text{div}}}^{-1}& 0 \\
0 & MG_{\bM_{\bu,\bu}H^1}^{-1}
\end{bmatrix}\qquad
\bM=\begin{bmatrix}
\bM_{\bsigma,\bsigma} &\bM_{\bsigma,\bu} \\
\bM_{\bsigma,\bu}^T &\bM_{\bu,\bu} 
\end{bmatrix}
\qquad
\bP \bM \bbx = \bP  \bb
\end{align*}
This also means we have to solve the system in a staggered way and not monolithically.  Different methods can be considered to deal with the two blocks of the matrix:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jacobi: $ \bM_{\bsigma,\bsigma} \bsigma^{k+1}=\bb_{\bsigma} -\bM_{\bsigma,\bu}\bu^{k}$,
$ \bM_{\bu,\bu} \bu^{k+1}=\bb_{\bu} -\bM_{\bsigma,\bu}^T\bsigma^{k}$.
\item Block Gauss-Seidel: $ \bM_{\bsigma,\bsigma} \bsigma^{k+\frac{1}{2}}=\bb_{\bsigma} -\bM_{\bsigma,\bu}\bu^{k}$,
$ \bM_{\bu,\bu} \bu^{k+1}=\bb_{\bu} -\bM_{\bsigma,\bu}^T\bsigma^{k+\frac{1}{2}}$.
\item Conjugate Gradient with the block diagonal preconditioner $\bP$.
\end{itemize}
Now we want to understand how the stress-block $\bM_{\bsigma,\bsigma} $ is transformed when it is written for the potential variable. 
For a fixed value of the displacement $\bu$, we can write the raw of the system related to the stress in the following way:
\begin{align*}
\int_{\Omega}\text{div}  \bsigma \cdot \text{div} \btau + \mathcal{A} \bsigma : \mathcal{A} \btau =  \int_{\Omega} \varepsilon(\bu) :  \mathcal{A} \btau -\int_{\Omega} \bff \text{div} \:\btau 
\end{align*}
or alternatively $\langle \bA \sigma, \btau \rangle = \langle \bff (\bu), \btau \rangle$. By spilliting the solution in $\bsigma=\br + \bcurl \bphi$, where $\br \in \mathcal{N}(\text{div})^{\perp}$, $\bcurl \bphi \in \mathcal{N}(\text{div})$, we can at first solve for $\br$ and then for $\bphi$. For computing $\br$ we solve the original problem $\langle \bA \br, \btau \rangle = \langle \bff , \btau \rangle$.  For $\bphi$ we observe that, if $\textbf{res}=\bff-\bA\br$:
\begin{align*}
\qquad \langle \bA (\br + \bcurl \bphi) \, \by \rangle = \langle \bff , \by \rangle 
\quad \rightarrow \quad \langle \bA \br, \btau \rangle + \langle\bcurl \bphi , \btau \rangle = \langle \bff , \btau \rangle 
\quad \rightarrow \quad \langle \bA\bcurl \bphi , \bcurl \bpsi \rangle  =\langle \textbf{res} ,  \bcurl \bpsi \rangle  \quad \forall \bpsi
\end{align*}
The problem for the potential variable $\bphi$ reads as follows:
search for $\bphi \in H^{\text{div}}(\Omega)$ such that:
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
C_2 \int_{\Omega}  \mathcal{A} \bcurl \phi^{k+1} : \mathcal{A} \bcurl \psi + C_3 \text{asym}(\bcurl \phi^{k+1} ): \text{asym}(\bcurl \psi^{k+1} )= \int_{\Omega} \textbf{res} :  \bcurl \psi &
\forall \bpsi \in \left[ H_{\Gamma_N^0}^{\bcurl}(\Omega) \right]^d \\
 \bcurl \bphi  \bn  =0 & \Gamma_N
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
In the LS setting Neumann conditions can be enforced in an essential manner. Therefore $\bsigma \bn =\bg$ is exactly satisfied and its residual is zero. For this reason the bc is now $\bcurl \bphi  \bn  =0 $. In the 2D/3D FE discretization the normal $\bn$  on a point $n$/an edge $e$ is the average of the two normals on the edges/faces, $e_1$/$F_1$ and $e_2$/$F_2$, that share the node/edge itself. For first-order Lagrange/Nedelec elements $P_1$/$\ND_1$,  this bc is no more local. In order to make easier the understaing, let us focus on the 2D case and substitute $\phi=\sum \phi_i C_i$. Let 2 be the Neumann node of interest, 1 and 2 its  boundary neighbours and A and B the relative triangles. Then we have:
\begin{align*}
( \bcurl \phi_{1,a} C_1 +\bcurl \phi_{2,a} C_2  )\bn_a + (\bcurl \phi_{2,b} C_2 +\bcurl \phi_{3,b} C_3 )\bn_b=0 \quad \rightarrow \quad 
\begin{cases} 
C_1 M_1 +C_2 M_2 +C_3 M_3=0\\
M_1=  \bcurl \phi_{1,a} \cdot \bn_a\\
M_2=\bcurl \phi_{2,a} \cdot \bn_a +\bcurl \phi_{2,b} \cdot \bn_b\\
M_3=\bcurl \phi_{3,b} \cdot \bn_b
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
By construction, $\bcurl \phi_{i,j} \cdot \bn_a=\nabla\phi_{i,j} \cdot \bt_j \neq 0$, for $i=1,2,3$, $j=a,b$. Indeed, on the edge defined by the tangent $ \bt_j $, each shape function $\phi_{i,j}$ varies from 0 to 1, meaning that in this direction the gradient cannot be zero and neither its dot product with the tangent iself. Consequently $M_1$, $M_3\neq 0$. Nevertheless it can happen that $M_2=0$, since it is the sum of two signed terms. This is the case, for example, of a simple structured rectangular grid (see picture).

\end{figure}
Therefore, if the Neumann nodes are ordered from 1 to $N$, we obtain a tridiagonal system, whose main diagonal can be zero and such that the right hand side is zero except for the first and last component. These ones can be computed in terms of $c_0$ and $c_{N+1}$, so they are not known a priori. In particular they are the values of the boundary points adjacent to the extreme Neumann boundary points (briefly, they are Dirichlet bc of the original problem).  The system that we obtain is the following:
\begin{align*}
M c_{\text{Neumann}}=R\qquad
M=
\begin{bmatrix}
  M_{11} &M_{12} & 0& 0 &...& 0\\
  M_{21} &M_{22} &   M_{23} & 0& ...& 0\\ 
0   &M_{32} &   M_{33} &M_{34}& ...& 0\\ 
0 & 0 & ...  & ...&...& 0\\
0  & 0  & 0  & 0  &   M_{N,N-1} &M_{N N}\\ 
  \\  
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
R=
\begin{bmatrix}
  -M_{10}c_0\\
0\\
0\\
0\\
  -M_{N,N+1}c_{N+1}\\
  \\  
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*} 
Given this kind of boundary conditions, we cannot use a Thomas-algorithm neither simple smoothers like Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel in the standard way. According to these ones, the main diagonal must be different from zero. Unfortunately with these bc, we add some zero terms to the main diagonal. This means that we have to deal with Neumann nodes in a different way. First of all is sure that we cannot solve directly for them and then use usual smoothers for the rest of the system. In fact the right hand side strictly depends on the other internal values and we need to search for an interative scheme.  \\
In order to iteratively solve the sytem, let us exploit the fact that the unknown is a potential variable and enforce its value in a point. In particular, we substitute the last raw by $c_1=0$ and then solve, in cascade, for $c_i$ $i=2...N$. Before going to the internal nodes, one can compute with the usual smoother $c_{N+1}$, then $c_0$, $c_1$ and restart the computation of the bc. We remark that the whole procedure works only if the Neumann boundary is connected. Of course, for each connected portion of the Neumann boundary, the structure of the system is the same, but starting from the second boundary, we cannot impose the potential anymore. \\
The 3D case is similar to the 2D one, but it is more complicated. Now, for each Neumann edge,  the boundary equation involves five edge-dofs. So the system is pentadiagonal and the main diagonal can have zero entries as well. Furthermore in 2D we can solve the system as a cascade, because on the boundary a node talks only to its left and right nodes. In 3D the scenario strictly depends on the configuration of the boundary mesh. Also the right hand side has more non-zero entries. Therefore the arising system can be more complicated. This is one of the reasons why we would like to avoid the use of Hiptmair smoother.
\section{Signorini problem: strong formulation}
Our purpose is to generalize everything that has been explained for linear elasticity to contat problems. 
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\text{div} \bsigma + \bff=0 & \Omega  \qquad \text{momentum balance equation}\\
\mathcal{A} \bsigma - \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)=0 &\Omega \qquad \text{constitutive law}\\
\bu = \bu^D & \Gamma_D\\
\bsigma \cdot \bn = \bt^N & \Gamma_N\\
\end{cases} 
\end{align*}
with the constraints:
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
\bu \cdot \bn - g  \leq 0 & \Gamma_D \qquad \text{impenetrability}\\
(\bsigma \bn) \cdot \bn \leq 0 &\Gamma_N \qquad \text{direction of the surface pressure}\\
\langle \bu \cdot \bn -g, (\bsigma \bn) \cdot \bn \rangle_{\Gamma_c}=0 & \Gamma_C \subset \Gamma_N \qquad \text{complementarity condition}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
Between the two possible formulations, the one that uses $\mathcal{A} \bsigma -\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=0$ is preferred to $\bsigma - \mathcal{C} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=0$. In this way, we can also deal with near incompressible or incompressible materials ($\lambda \gg 1$, $\lambda \to \infty$).
\begin{align*}
&\mathcal{A} \bsigma= \dfrac{1}{2 \mu} \left(\bsigma-\dfrac{\lambda}{d \lambda + 2 \mu } \text{tr} \bsigma \bI\right)\\
&\mathcal{C} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\lambda \text{tr} \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu) \bI+ 2 \mu \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)
\end{align*}
We could use the linear elasticity LS-functional subject to the contact-constraints. Nevertheless it is difficult to deal with the non linear complementary condition. For this reason, we augment the LS functional by a boundary term, that is always positive if the conditions on impenetrability and direction of the surface pressure are satisfied.
\begin{align*}
 \mathcal{J}(\bu,\bsigma)=||\text{div} \bsigma+\bff||_{L^2(\Omega)^d}^2+||\mathcal{A}\bsigma -\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\bu)||_{L^2(\Omega)^d}^2   \quad \rightarrow \quad \min_{\bu,\bsigma} \mathcal{J}
\end{align*}
